Todo:
1. ImageTextureComponent:
 > Needs to be correlated to a mesh or rectangle of some sort. Needs to be specific
 > Needs to be able to be instantiated like any other component
2. Give Components random ids DONE
3. Entities
4. Some sort of component / entity manager
5. Blueprint components


NOTES:
 Need to find a efficient way of doing the following lookups:
  1. CID -> Comp*
  2. CName -> List<CID>
  3. Entity -> List<CID>
  4. CID -> Entity
